### Idea

Design and build a small-scale, autonomous catamaran (1.2m) capable of carrying a 10 kg payload with 2-hour operating endurance and 3D printed, constructed primarily from sustainable materials (70% or more). A key feature is the ability to easily integrate internal and external sensors, with a focus on cost-effective and simple repairability.

This vessel could be used as a platform for maritime engineering training and aquatic bioecochemistry or water quality assessment. 

It will uses modeling and 3D printing with PLA, with the possiblility of exploring new ecofriendly materials: environmentally friendly from the very begining of the conceptualization until the moment that is out of service.

The control, in a early stage, is by radio and GPS way points using Mission Planner of ARDUPILOT software opensource community. If needed could have an avoidance system. ARDUPILOT, is an open-source autopilot software suite where mission Planner is a product. 

The energy system should use Samsung 18650 cells in a two bateries 4S4P setting in paralell (16.8 V). This system can be charged with solar pannels or a 220 V home energy source.

For the spare parts it should have cheap components easily available on the market.

All started here, at FAB ACADEMY 2019, held in FCT FAB LAB at Nova University: https://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/fct/students/antonio-gomes/projects/final-project/

## February ##
Resin the hulls. Because of the weather its was a very slow process. 
We never reach the minimum temperature of 21 degrees and 60% of humidity.

| **Resin the hulls** |  |  
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| ![](Photos/AQUA2.JPG) | ![](Photos/AQUA9.JPG) |

As you can see, there is a chemical reaction between the resin and the paint. The good news is that, if you repaint, it will vanishes! great!!!

Primary painting. All the errors appear!

![](Photos/AQUA21.JPG)


## March ##

Fill the holes and repaint after sanding, sanding and sanding. Repaint again. This process is not going well because it continues to react showing spots of orange (see pictures). We think to change the process in order to have more 3D printed only and putting the UV paint only. It avoids a lot of work and mess.

## April ##


| In April we finnaly concluded the painting. |  |

| ![](Photos/AQUA35.jpg) | ![](Photos/AQUA36.jpg) |

We did the UV paint with this brand.

![](Photos/AQUA37.jpg)

The process is not environmentally friendly as we suspected: so, we plan to produce this catamara in a different way by taking the 3D printing strategy further, meaning that, we do not wanted to add to much to the 3D printing process, just the UV painting, and we want to assume the 3D printing "anommalous" desing by not be embarassed because of this consequent strange design. We will not 

## May ##

Spaghetti time! Designing the wiring and accomodating the hardware to control the AQUA.

| ![](Photos/EnergiaControle_1.JPG) | ![](Photos/EnergiaControle_2.JPG) | ![](Photos/EnergiaControle_3.JPG) |

We are also looking the way to adjust, with flexible material, the front and rear bars that go inside the boat. They are connected by two screws in each side.

![](Photos/longarinas_frechas1.JPG)

Future: looking forward to test it in a pool. 

## July ##
Cleaning was a task at this point and measuring the type of garbage and the weight in percentage of the catamaran is a reference to take the sustainability into account. The complete weigth of the catamaran is 20,5 Kg with an error of 0,2 Kg. So the waste produce in the fabrication of the catamaran was 22,1 Kg this time, 107,8 % of the mass of the catamara. 

Since we don't know how to process this catamara in is end of life, we coclude that, at that time, there will be 42,6 kg of waste, which include eletronic parts and plastic less environmentaly friendly. So, in the end of his life there will 207,3% of waste, compared to the mass of the catamaran.

| Type  | Weigth (kg) | % |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Paper  | 1,2 | 6 |
| Cardboard | 5,6 | 2,7 |
| Plastic  | 5,8 | 2,8 |
| Painting cans | 1,8 (18 cans) | 0,1 |

We found a structural break in the hull. Perhaps because of a falling situation when removing from the car. Preparing to fix it.

![](Photos/AquaBreak_1.jpg)

We are going to try to fix it. 

We reprint the access hatch in the top of both hulls with less holes then before, since we decided to have only one openning for the telemetry antenna. This aquatic plataform will serve as a base to have anything that the school need. We reprint the eletronic box and made the battery 4S4P.

## March

Structural break fixed. After sanding and cleaning with a dremel, and prepared the epoxi glue the results:

![](Photos/breakFixed.JPG)

Thinking about the unbalance hull. That's a big issue that didn't appear so important but with the real hull it appears very disturbing. Two solutions, taking in account that this is a prototype: 

1. modeling a boid to attach to the bow in order to balance it;
2. glue a foam under the bow.

![](Photos/AQUA_march2025.jpeg)

# Tasks
- [x] Structural break;
- [x] Assemble the last cleat;
- [x] Glue the foam to the bow;
- [x] Paint with yellow and varnish;
- [x] Attach security light
- [x] Testing...

The top covers were left unvarnished to directly observe the behavior of the PLA material and compare it to the varnished sections. Foam was adhered to the underside of the hulls to enhance the catamaran's stability. Elastic structures were integrated to securely fasten the covers. Finally, the last coats of paint were applied, and the top hull covers were tightened to improve water tightness. The paint didn't work weel in the foam.

## June

We have made a heavy testing of the boat. Even the transportation was a testing point. The boat is to wide for the van. yes!!! Wrong turn!!!We need to cut the floats stringers by 7 cm. 

![](Photos/toWideVan.jpg)

The heat was another testing point. 

![](Photos/heatResult.jpeg)

The top covers were replaced because the rubber fixers where not appropiate for the heat during the transportation incide the van. The new top covers where made with EPS machineed at the Porto de Mós FAB LAB.

| ![](Photos/CNCportoMos.jpeg) | ![](Photos/CNCPortoMos2.jpeg) |

We also print parts to insure that the water doesn't get inside the hulls. We also modeled fixers for the top float covers that use straps .

![](Photos/starBoardHullCloseSensor.jpg)

This is crucial. We need to glue the front floaters or the boat will not be horizontal in the water (see February pictures). During the transportation they got out. Another wrong turn!

Tomorrow I'm going to assemble the engine. It was removed when I moved it on the table. Issues around the use of the boat.

![](Photos/bronkenMotor.jpeg)

Boat ready to test. We machine the parts on the FAB LAB CNC machine of Porto de Mós FAB LAB. Fix them with flat ropes.

![](Photos/pronto.jpeg)

## August

Tests on 10 August. Add a handcart to move it easily.

![](Photos/prontoErvedeira.jpeg)

![](Photos/prontoErvedeira2.jpeg)

It goes ok as you can see in the video. The bow is a little bit down but we will add more flutuability in the next iteraction. Everything was fine... When I opened it, it has water inside!!! Brr....

In the next day I weard water moving also inside. The boat is taking on water, I don't know where from. I should none that because hobbiecat does that...

Water testing.

![](Photos/testeÁguaInfiltração.jpeg)

### UPPS!
Water is coming in through the four screw holes and the both electrical wires that powers the engine. But it doesn't go directly into the boat, it enters the hull and then comes out through interior grooves in the bow... that are result of the way the boat was built... I'll insulate it as best I can... and hope for the best. I use silicone in the wire hole and the screws.

![](Photos/silicone.jpeg)

Notice that the starboard paint peeled off.

![](Photos/peeledOff.jpeg)

Using the air compressed most of the paint went off.

Addint the feature of measuring current and voltage.

![](Photos/medicoes.jpeg)

Apply silicone... dry for 6 hours and put it on water again.

![](Photos/silicone.jpeg)

Took water inside again but less... but it worked... buzzer ringing again.
Interior water also. F...

Today, Sunday, it's drying! I put it back also. Lift it in several positions for the ware to came out from the grooves: it was upside down because the water comes out inside, at the stern, and then drains inside, but at the top of the hull.
when tilted, you can no longer hear the sound of water inside.

![](Photos/secagem.jpeg)

Possible entries points. Need procedures to handle the boat. I will try to test the way points. In spite of not having internet on the locals we can use fetching with MP.

### CONCLUSION

Water is coming in through the four screw holes and the both electrical wires that powers the engine. But it doesn't go directly into the boat, it enters the hull and then comes out through interior grooves in the bow... that are result of the way the boat was built... I'll insulate it as best I can... and hope for the best. I use silicone in the wire hole and the screws.

No data collected yet... just see what's going on: audible warnings that needed to be understanded, seems to have same battery heating (we should have an internal temperature sensor). Strange sound... try to understand what it means... it's not from the pixwack because we don't have the buzzer (well, we don't have it now but we had it, it broke)... but the button to start the engines before arming in the MP software... it has... investigate what it means. It working alright. We plan to repaint the hulls in October. So, we will came back to it in October, now, vacations!

### WARNING!!!
Reparing the boat more carefully confront us with the epoxy problem, that came out to be a problem:
1. Waterproof epoxy: we didn't use it;
2. We should had sanded the PLA to create roughness;
3. The preparations painting stages and the wating times are crucial to have a good result: so, reading the technical documents its crucial

Always learning in the hard way.

Next: Repairing. Painting. We also had to change the T200 thrusthers because, whenever we put the floats in the horizontal we didn't notice they they slihtly touch the ground and the structure broke.

## October

- [x] Valves: buy
- [x] Engine covers, buy
- [x] more flutuability to the bow: improve with a bolt...
- [x] BUY the flag
- [x] PVC for the holes of the motor atachment
- [x] Buy lights: white, red, green!?
- [x] Procedures
- [x] repair and paint the hulls (see procedure bellow)
- [x] Charging procedure: improve circuit and carefully with both bateries in mind;
- [x] print and paint 3d float part;
- [x] Reassemble the T200   
- [x] GPS problem: no led light blinking...
- [x] strange warning PIXWACK beeps!? They were from the safety switch (https://ardupilot.org/rover/docs/common-sounds-pixhawkpx4.html#common-sounds-pixhawkpx4)
- [x] test the voltage accuracy;

We followed this **paint procedure**:

1. 3D printing the bow floats;
2. Sand the hulls to remove the paint as much as possible (120 to 220);
3. Prepare the holes for the bow floats, thruster cables, valves and the three lights (red, green and white);
4. Close the holes (prepare the repair compound using two spatulas: just a drop of hardener is enough);
5. Wait 24 hours;
6. Sand the parts where we applied the repair compound;
7. Clean with a sponge;
8. Apply epoxi primer with the paint roller and brush: after preparing we have two hours to apply it;
9. Wait 1 day and paint: if you can't, wait 5 days for the paint to become glazed, sand again with 220-grit sandpaper and paint (the sanding is for the paint adhesion);
10. Certify that there are no "holidays": repaint if needed with the primer mix with thinner (not to much, just to loar a little bit the viscosity;
11. Apply yellow enamel paint (polyurethane plus acrylate) with the roller and the brush:
    (a) stir well before mixing;
    (b) make half and then the rest if needed: after two hours the rest is not reusable: clean the brush with thinner and throw away the rolls;
12. Wait two days;
13. Repaint if needed using a little bit of thinner;
14. Mount the structure, flag, lights, batteries, eletronics and eletrical parts;
15. Test, test, test and test!

![](Photos/outTeste2.jpeg)

But, it sudendly stoped because the electric terminals that I use in the thrusters wire didn't handle the high current. The "strange warning PIXWACK beeps!?" where not exactly from pixhwack but from the safety switch buzzer saying thta the batery was low.
After this repairing the boat was tested and more water inside... grrr.... everywhere, from the hulls (more on the starboard) and small floats on the bow.

Lights where a nightmare! After trying to understand all the documenting about ardurover firmware outdated; finnaly though that it was tight, but no... I even get a multimeter and an arduino uno to see what happen to the pins when I was pushing the radio button to turn on the lights... they seemeddead. Why are they all dead? Seeking to find same parameter in the thousand of parameters that keep the pin LOW. Well... it was just a button: push the safety button because, if not, pins are no enabled!!! Grrr...

We have lights! White, red and green.

Now AQUA is assembled again, with valves and lights: ready to be tested.
The test when good for about 30 minuts but it starts to be get water inside again. At the same time one of the switchs broke, I don't know if because of heat (high currrent) or another reason. The main switch is bronken. Changed! Everything seems ok now. All the lateral conections between the aluminium bars, the stringers, and the floats where filled with silicone. After drying we will test again.

Restart again... Everything on the boat must be very well sealed. Today we tested again and it works very weel; there is, still, some water in, but it's a small quantity, and we will reseal again.

Problems: battery warning are not consistent with the measuring; warning of the giroscope calibration are confusing because the calibration was done and in the past we never get it. Problems with the normal driving mode; a little bit of water: resealing!

## November/December 2025

This november we had a benificial meeting with [ESTM](https://www.ipleiria.pt/estm/) Politenic University school belong to [IPLeiria](https://www.ipleiria.pt/) where the sea and water areas are important for their biology research and training teams.

It was decided that we will start a program from March 2026 to July 2026 to test, use as a pedagogical tool and as a platform fro plancton research.
So, our major task now is to prepare everything in order for ESTM has the best experience with our USV platform. And we are also keen to know the reception in March and the outcames in July.

For now this are the tasks until **March 2026**: prepare, prepare and prepare, and test, test and test!

Use VRC e VRD as 6 position navigation mode: for a nice explanation follow this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BVSjSCz8f4&t=141s

## Problems

We choose the normal, auto, loiter, guided, ACRO and SRTL.
We had problems with the battery safety warnings saying "unhealthy batery": solution was within the power module selection for voltage and battery capacity;
We also had problems with unhealthy AHRS: we did a acceleration calibration only with the pixwack box and not with the entire AQUA;
Problems with the compass: alighn N-S and mag recal and reboot.
At this moment no problems with water inside.
Problems with the telemetry antenas. It fall down around 15 meters... the issue a missing pin...

![](Photos/pinoProblemaTelemetria.jpeg)

This raised the issue of the **radio frequency** rules in Portugal: we can use the 433 MHz but with a maximum power of 1 W: https://www.anacom.pt/streaming/anexo2.pdf?contentId=797080&field=ATTACHED_FILE

The logistics is an issue to tackle in february, because getting wet when putting the vessel in the water is a problem and transporting it, another one.

AQUA run arount 1h:15min and use 80% of the batery and it showed the safety batery sound warning. this is because there a diuference of 1 V between what the power module is measuring and what the voltmeter register. Calibration needed.

## Jannuary 2026

- [x] Calibrating the voltage and current measure in MP software parameters;
- [x] buy a USBC longer cable;
- [x] Test autonomy;

Consumes 5% of energy in 40 minutes at a speed around 1 m/s (4 km/h) speed. So, up to 80% will have an autonomy of 160 minutes... 2.5 hours. Up to 60%, the limit, 5 hours.
Radio working fine. GPS came late. During one hour didn't connect. In the end of the test it fix with 5/6 satelites. In the second day the same. Never fix and it doesn't show any satelite. In the afternoon I unplug and plug again the GPS and it starts wotking wit 6 satelites fixed. Is it the connector? Will we need a second GPS? With this problem we cannot rub by waypoints. Between measured tension there is a 1 V diference. Need to check again.
Small entrance of water on port hull: bujons need to be better fixed.

I made this float based on the previous one to see what weight we could achieve. It was reduced to 5 kg, 5 days of printing in four parts, without infill with 6 walls, printed on QIDI, at 200 m/s. This means we can have an AQUA weighing 13 kg instead of the current 21 kg... we estimate that the payload at this moment is a little over 5 Kg, but if we can save 8 kg in the hulls we can gain a payload about 10 Kg.

We are going in two problems, Nicla Vision Assembling and GPS powering. About Nicla Vision the issue is how to power up and fix: this pictures shows the status solution:

The other issue its about GPS mentioned above. For now we have this four ways to know if the GPS is working and we have confirmed that is working:

1. Check the HUD (Heads-Up Display) on the Flight Data screen: "No GPS" Message: the Pixhawk cannot find the module. "No Fix" Message: If it says "No Fix," it hasn't found enough satellites yet.

2. View Live Satellite Data
Under the map on the Flight Data screen, look for the "gpshdop" and "sats" values: "sats" shows 0 but the status is not "No GPS," the module is powered and working, just waiting for a signal. Completely blank or "0" while the HUD says "No GPS," the module likely has no power. 

3. Use the Messages Tab 
At the bottom of the Flight Data screen, click the Messages tab: Look for a message saying "GPS 1: detected as u-blox at [baud rate]" shortly after you connect or reboot the Pixhawk. If you see "GPS 1: fail to initialize" or no GPS message at all, it indicates a power or wiring issue. 

4. Hardware Verification (MAVSerial Pass-through)
In Mission Planner, press Ctrl+F and select "MAVSerial Pass". If u-center can see the module, it is powered and functional. 

The next issue is: what is delaying the GPS so long? Gemini AI say this: M8N Pixhawk GPS modules take hours to fix satellites
due to a lack of a valid almanac/ ephemeris (satellite data), often from being powered off too long, significant travel (>100 miles), or poor signal/interference, leading to a slow cold start, with potential issues being battery drain on the Real-Time Clock (RTC) or internal interference from nearby drone electronics (like VTXes or cameras) hindering satellite reception. A good M8N should get a fix in minutes, but hours indicates a serious problem like a faulty antenna, damaged LNA/filter, or massive RF interference. We will stick to RF interference for now and see what happen, because we have the radio antena to close to the GPS. And now I remember that the GPS fix happen when the radio was off: it happen on the Figueira da Foz Port. So, testing that and changing the antennas position. Lets see.

Novalty is to have Henrique on board, hope he have time to join the project.
